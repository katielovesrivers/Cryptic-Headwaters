First- and second-order channel geometries (bankfull width and depth), minimum channel length, and identifiers.
Width and depth measured in the field with a ruler. 
Geode GNS3S (<1m accuracy) GPS points collected at channel and/or stream head, terminus (confluence with another stream), and (length allowing) intermediate points; ArcGIS Pro used to connect points for minimum channel length estimations. 
Identifiers include Strahler stream order (as assessed in the field), flow status and elevation (flowing vs. not flowing, low vs. high elevation), and glacial history (glaciated or unglaciated).
Field sites located in CO (Surprise Creek, Neota Creek, Jacks Gulch), with limited subset of data collected on Rausch Creek in PA. 
CO fieldwork carried out in Summer 2025, PA fieldwork carried out in Winter 2025.
